# Own Dynamic Web Server

A simple, configurable, and dynamic web server built with C++. This server is capable of serving static HTML files, executing PHP scripts, and can be easily configured via a `server.conf` file.

## Features

- **Static File Serving:** Serve HTML files directly from a specified directory.
- **PHP Script Execution:** Execute PHP files and return the generated output.
- **Configurable Settings:** Easily change server settings like port, IP address, file preferences, and more via `server.conf`.
- **Logging:** Logs server activity to a `.log` file for easy monitoring.
- **Automatic Index File Loading:** Automatically load index files (e.g., `index.html` or `index.php`) based on the configuration.
- **Custom 404 Error Page:** Serve a custom 404 page if the requested resource is not found.
